# FrameQ Architecture

## 2026-07-06 Personalized Insight Preferences Boundary

- The desktop UI owns the inspiration-profile setup flow, the per-run six-step generation-preference wizard, confirmation summaries, and result-detail actions such as `换个方向`.
- Tauri owns app-local persistence for the inspiration profile. The profile should be stored as a constrained local JSON file, not in app-local `.env`, and Tauri commands must validate the file path under app-local data.
- If the user skips profile setup, Tauri persists a local skipped marker such as `profileSkipped: true` without profile fields. This marker suppresses repeated first-use prompts but must not create an implicit default persona.
- The per-run preference snapshot is passed to `retry_insights` together with the saved official transcript reference. It may be recorded in the local task manifest as user-visible context for already-generated AI artifacts.
- The worker treats profile and generation preferences as structured prompt context for insight-topic generation only. Summary and Mermaid mindmap generation continue to use the generic AI整理 prompts and must not read the personalized preference snapshot. The worker must not infer hidden preferences from unrelated history.
- For insight-topic generation, the worker should preserve LLM context budget by using transcript chunks, summaries, or candidate excerpts plus a compact structured preference JSON. It should not concatenate a full long transcript and verbose preference prose into a single prompt.
- FrameQ server continues to own only account, entitlement, quota, and LLM checkout. It must not receive or store inspiration profiles, generation preferences, transcripts, generated insights, or local task manifests.
- Quota is counted per cloud LLM API call attempt: `1 quota use = 1 supplier chat-completion/API call attempt`. A confirmed AI整理 attempt may consume multiple quota uses because summary, Mermaid mindmap, topic planning, and insight-topic generation can be separate LLM calls. Re-running via `换个方向` starts a new confirmed AI整理 attempt and consumes quota again according to the new attempt's actual LLM calls. Failed, timed-out, unparsable, or partially failed calls remain consumed once attempted.
- The LLM supplier may receive transcript snippets only after the user confirms AI整理. The selected preference snapshot may be sent only with the insight-topic generation request, not with summary or Mermaid mindmap requests.

## 2026-07-05 Desktop Diagnostics Boundary

- The Tauri desktop layer owns app-local diagnostic logs at `logs/frameq-desktop.log`.
- Diagnostics record desktop command lifecycle, worker exit status, task id, structured error code, and sanitized short messages.
- Worker task diagnostics remain under app-local `cache/tasks/<task_id>/` when task-specific temporary evidence is needed; desktop logs are global support evidence, not user artifacts.
- YouTube extraction may explicitly enable local JavaScript runtimes supported by `yt-dlp` (`deno`, `node`, `quickjs`, `bun`) but must still run as a worker-owned public-link download policy.
- Release packages bundle Deno in `resources/bin` so clean Windows and macOS machines have a local JavaScript runtime available for `yt-dlp` YouTube player evaluation.

## 2026-07-05 Task-Owned Artifact Store Boundary

- A processing run is now a first-class task. The worker creates `<output_root>/tasks/<task_id>/frameq-task.json` and writes all final user artifacts under that same task directory.
- Final artifacts use stable names inside task folders: `media/video.mp4`, `media/audio.wav`, `transcript/transcript.txt`, `transcript/transcript.md`, `transcript/segments.json`, `ai/summary.md`, `ai/mindmap.mmd`, `ai/insights.json`, and `ai/insights.md`.
- App-local `cache/tasks/<task_id>/` owns temporary downloads, partial files, media merge scratch space, and diagnostics. It is not the user-facing artifact contract.
- `frameq-task.json` is the source of truth for desktop history and artifact lookup. Any app-local cache index is rebuildable, not the authority.
- Tauri may satisfy a repeated source URL from an existing completed or partial-completed task manifest when the transcript artifact still exists. This cache hit returns the existing task result before worker launch; unusable or broken old tasks are skipped.
- Tauri commands should resolve artifacts from `task_id` and manifest-relative paths only. They must not accept arbitrary transcript/audio/result paths for normal task operations.
- The old flat-output/history contract is intentionally retired for new builds. Legacy flat outputs and legacy app-local history records do not need migration or compatibility behavior.

## 2026-07-05 Subtitle-First Transcript Source Boundary

- The worker may request public platform subtitle files for YouTube and Bilibili `yt-dlp` success paths before loading ASR. This is a worker-owned transcript optimization, not a new UI platform crawler or download workflow.
- Subtitle probing runs after media validation/audio extraction and before ASR model readiness/loading checks. This preserves the current `media/video.mp4`, `media/audio.wav`, audio review, result cards, and history behavior while skipping only ASR model load/inference when subtitles are usable.
- Bilibili public fallback does not fetch or reuse subtitles in v1. If `yt-dlp` fails and `download_bilibili_video` succeeds, the task continues through the existing ASR path.
- Subtitle parsing writes the same official `transcript/transcript.txt`, `transcript/transcript.md`, and `transcript/segments.json` artifacts as ASR. Later AI整理 continues to read the official saved transcript.
- `frameq-task.json` schema version 2 keeps top-level `model` as the configured ASR fallback model and adds `transcript: { source, language, engine }` for the actual transcript source. Schema version 1 manifests without `transcript` are treated as ASR-sourced for history restore.
- Raw `.vtt` / `.srt` files remain temporary files in `cache/tasks/<task_id>/download/` and are not user-facing artifacts or manifest paths.

## 2026-07-03 Transcript Detail and Audio Review Boundary

- Transcript audio review is split across the existing three local layers: worker produces optional segment metadata, Tauri performs constrained local file IO, and the frontend owns playback/editor interaction state.
- The worker may emit a sidecar `<stem>_transcript_segments.json` when ASR output contains trustworthy sentence timing or, for SenseVoice long-audio runs, when the built-in FSMN-VAD provides speech block timing and each block is transcribed directly. The sidecar shape is `segments: [{ id, start_ms, end_ms, text, speaker? }]`; `speaker` is metadata only and must not drive seek, highlight, or edit behavior.
- Existing transcript `.txt` and `.md` files remain the official text artifacts. The segment sidecar is optional enhancement metadata, so old tasks and ASR outputs without valid timing keep working as full-text review.
- Tauri owns `load_transcript_detail` and `save_transcript_edit` commands. These commands validate local transcript/audio paths, read/write only approved transcript artifacts, create the first original backup, and update local history previews after save.
- Tauri must not expose arbitrary file playback or arbitrary text-file write commands. Frontend audio playback may only use paths returned by the validated detail command.
- The frontend owns the native audio element, current segment selection, playback-following highlight, edit pause/resume behavior, dirty state, copy-from-draft behavior, and save feedback.
- Later AI整理 must read the saved official transcript, not an unsaved frontend draft.

## 2026-06-29 YouTube Public Video Support Boundary

- YouTube v1 is a worker-owned `yt-dlp` command policy, not a new platform crawler. UI and Tauri continue to submit one source string and receive the existing worker result shape.
- The frontend may accept public YouTube watch, short, and Shorts URLs, but it does not parse YouTube pages, select formats, import cookies, or manage downloads.
- The worker keeps `yt-dlp --no-playlist` and adds a YouTube-specific 720p transcription-first format selector that prefers MP4 video plus M4A audio when available.
- Successful YouTube downloads produce a normal local media file and then reuse the existing `ffprobe`, FFmpeg audio extraction, ASR, history, summary, Mermaid mindmap, and insight pipeline without new result fields.
- YouTube-specific failures are classified only inside the worker error message as sanitized `YOUTUBE_*` prefixes under the existing top-level `VIDEO_DOWNLOAD_FAILED` error.
- YouTube v1 must not add YouTube login, browser cookie import, cookies-from-browser, Authorization headers, proxy/bypass settings, playlist batching, live-stream handling, age/member/private bypass, stream picker UI, or a download-center product surface.

## 2026-06-27 Bilibili Public Video Fallback Boundary

- Bilibili fallback remains worker-owned and ordinary-public-video-only. UI and Tauri submit a source string and receive the existing worker result shape; they do not call Bilibili APIs, select DASH streams, import cookies, or manage downloads.
- The frontend may accept ordinary Bilibili BV/av video URLs and safe `b23.tv` short links, but all platform interpretation happens inside the Python worker.
- The worker should port EasyDownload's ordinary Bilibili parser, Web API, DASH stream selection, backup URL, and FFmpeg merge ideas into `worker/frameq_worker/bilibili_fallback.py` and shared download helpers, not call or bundle the Go/Wails EasyDownload runtime.
- `yt-dlp` stays the first attempt. Bilibili fallback runs only after a Bilibili-related failure and only for public or user-authorized ordinary videos.
- The fallback should parse BV/av IDs, resolve safe `b23.tv` links, select a single part from `?p=N` or the first part, fetch `x/web-interface/view` and `x/player/playurl`, choose one video stream plus one audio stream, download `.m4s` files safely, and merge them to MP4 with the existing bundled FFmpeg.
- The fallback must not add Bilibili QR login, account login automation, `SESSDATA` collection or storage, browser cookie import, PGC/bangumi support, VIP/member-only access, DRM decryption, stream picker UI, batch queue, proxy pools, or a download-center product surface.

## 2026-06-27 Xiaohongshu Video Fallback Completion Boundary

- Xiaohongshu fallback remains worker-owned and video-only. UI and Tauri submit a source string and receive the existing worker result shape; they do not parse Xiaohongshu HTML, select streams, import cookies, or manage downloads.
- The frontend may accept Xiaohongshu share text, full note URLs, and short links, but all platform interpretation happens inside the Python worker.
- The worker should port EasyDownload's Xiaohongshu parser/client/downloader ideas into `worker/frameq_worker/xiaohongshu_fallback.py` and shared download helpers, not call or bundle the Go/Wails EasyDownload runtime.
- `yt-dlp` stays the first attempt. Xiaohongshu fallback runs only after a Xiaohongshu-related failure and only for public or user-authorized video notes.
- The fallback should preserve `xsec_token`, handle short-link `3xx` and embedded-HTML resolution, decode `gzip`/`br`/`deflate` note pages, parse `window.__INITIAL_STATE__`, rank video streams deterministically, and download through safe streaming `.part` behavior.
- The fallback must not add image album ZIP output, Live Photo sidecar output, stream picker UI, batch queue, login automation, browser cookie import, CAPTCHA solving, proxy pools, or private-note scraping.

## 2026-06-27 Admin Entitlement Adjustment Boundary

- Admin Web may manually compensate users by updating the existing `Entitlement` record's expiry and insight-generation quota fields; it must not introduce a separate entitlement source that bypasses the normal processing gate.
- Compensation is an administrator-only support workflow for product bugs, release regressions, or goodwill repair. It is not a public self-service refund, coupon, or subscription-management system.
- Manual quota compensation should add to `llmQuotaLimit` while preserving `llmQuotaUsed`, so consumed usage remains traceable and `/api/desktop/account` can keep computing remaining uses with the existing response shape.
- Manual expiry extension should use `base = max(now, current expiresAt)` for day-based extensions, with absolute expiry setting reserved for repair cases.
- Every successful adjustment must create an append-only server-side audit record with administrator identity, target user, reason, optional note, before/after expiry, before/after quota values, and timestamp.
- Desktop clients do not need a new API shape for this feature. They observe the result through the existing account status refresh, entitlement gate, and quota gate.

## 2026-06-26 Worker-Owned Download Strategy Boundary

- The Python worker owns all platform-specific public-link fallback strategy, safe media download helpers, candidate probing, media validation, and structured error mapping.
- UI and Tauri continue to pass a source URL into the existing command flow and receive the same worker JSON shape; they must not parse platform HTML, choose media candidates, manage cookies, or become a download queue.
- `yt-dlp` remains the first attempt for supported public links. Worker fallback code may run only after matching failures and only for public or user-authorized links that can expose a playable media URL.
- EasyDownload is an MIT-licensed design and algorithm reference. FrameQ should port the minimal needed behavior into `worker/` and must not import, shell out to, or bundle the Go/Wails application as a runtime dependency.
- Shared download reliability helpers may support `.part` files, resume-safe range checks, no-progress timeouts, maximum-size guardrails, and candidate retries, but they must preserve the current output/history/result contract.
- Xiaohongshu fallback is scoped to video suitable for transcription. Bilibili fallback is scoped to ordinary public videos that expose no-cookie DASH streams. Image albums, platform archiving, login-gated content, Bilibili PGC/bangumi/member-only/DRM behavior, and broad multi-platform downloader behavior are outside the desktop worker boundary.

## 2026-06-25 Douyin Share Page Fallback Boundary

- The Python worker owns Douyin fallback extraction. UI and Tauri commands continue to submit a source URL and receive the same structured worker result; they do not parse Douyin HTML, choose streams, or download media directly.
- The download path becomes a small strategy chain: attempt `yt-dlp` first, then, only for Douyin download failures that match empty web detail JSON or cookie/challenge-like extractor failures, attempt a local Douyin share page fallback.
- The fallback is derived from EasyDownload's MIT-licensed approach, but FrameQ should port the minimal algorithm into `worker/` rather than importing or bundling the Go/Wails EasyDownload application.
- The fallback extracts an `aweme_id`, requests `https://www.iesdouyin.com/share/video/{aweme_id}/?app=aweme`, parses `window._ROUTER_DATA`, builds stream candidates from `bit_rate` or `play_addr.uri`, and probes candidate streams with ranged GET requests.
- The fallback may use a fixed mobile Safari `User-Agent` (`iPhone OS 16_5`, Safari `604.1`) plus minimal public-page headers. It must not implement UA rotation, proxy pools, browser fingerprint spoofing, CAPTCHA solving, or account automation.
- A process-local cookie jar may keep anonymous cookies naturally issued by the public share page for the current worker invocation only; browser cookies are not read, persisted, or uploaded.
- Candidate selection is automatic. FrameQ chooses the largest valid stream by byte size to preserve the highest-quality local video for users who keep the downloaded file, with resolution or quality rank as a tie-breaker.
- Duplicate candidate streams should be collapsed by verified `Content-Range` total size. If the selected stream fails download or media validation, the worker tries the next candidate before surfacing failure.
- The selected media is written into the current task's `media/video.mp4` artifact and then flows through `ffprobe`, `ffmpeg`, ASR, task manifest, and result workspace handling.
- If all fallback candidates fail download or media validation, the worker returns a structured `VIDEO_DOWNLOAD_FAILED` with a short cause and recovery guidance; it must not hide the failed stage behind a generic worker error.

## 2026-06-23 Desktop Update Boundary

- Desktop app updates use Tauri updater signed artifacts and GitHub Releases as the static updater metadata/artifact host.
- The desktop updater endpoint is `https://github.com/jiabai/FrameQ/releases/latest/download/latest.json?frameq-updater=1`; release automation uploads `latest.json`, the NSIS installer, and signed updater bundles to the published GitHub Release.
- Python worker code upgrades together with the desktop application bundle; v1 does not support independent worker hot updates from app-local data.
- App-local data `updates.json` stores only update preferences such as `lastCheckedAt`, `postponedUntil`, and `skippedVersion`.
- App-local `models/`, `outputs/`, `cache/`, `auth/session.json`, and `.env` are preserved across app updates.
- Live old-version-to-new-version testing through GitHub Releases is waived for v1 because mainland China access to GitHub is too slow to test reliably. The updater architecture remains in place, but direct fresh-installer distribution is the accepted fallback for users whose network cannot reach GitHub Releases.

## 2026-06-23 Runtime Configuration Boundary

- Desktop worker runtime configuration no longer reads repository-root `.env` files such as `D:/Github/FrameQ/.env`.
- App-local data `.env` remains the local desktop settings file for output directory, ASR model selection, and model download overrides.
- The desktop settings panel returns and displays the app-local data `.env` path, can locate it in the file manager, and creates a commented template if the file is missing.
- Legacy local `FRAMEQ_LLM_PROVIDER`, `FRAMEQ_LLM_BASE_URL`, `FRAMEQ_LLM_API_KEY`, `FRAMEQ_LLM_MODEL`, and `FRAMEQ_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` dotenv values are ignored.
- Insight topic generation receives LLM runtime material only through server-managed checkout environment variables injected by Tauri for the insight-generation worker invocation.

## 2026-06-23 ASR Model Cache Layout Boundary

- `FRAMEQ_MODEL_DIR` is the app-local ModelScope cache root, not the directory that directly contains `iic/SenseVoiceSmall`.
- The canonical release ASR layout is `<FRAMEQ_MODEL_DIR>/models/iic/SenseVoiceSmall` plus `<FRAMEQ_MODEL_DIR>/models/iic/speech_fsmn_vad_zh-cn-16k-common-pytorch`.
- Worker startup keeps legacy top-level `iic/...` readable for upgrade compatibility, but normalizes it to the canonical layout before real ASR loading.
- Automatic cleanup is limited to FrameQ's known SenseVoice/VAD legacy directories and stale `._____temp` folders without `model.pt`.

## 2026-06-21 Account and Billing Boundary

- `server/` is a small TypeScript Fastify service for email OTP login, desktop session exchange, administrator-issued activation-code monthly passes, entitlement status, Admin Web, and server-managed LLM checkout.
- The service stores account and entitlement state in a private SQLite database at `server/data/frameq.sqlite` with WAL mode enabled. It is designed for a single writer service instance.
- The service stores encrypted administrator-managed LLM config for a dedicated FrameQ client supplier key and tracks per-user insight-generation quota.
- Desktop authentication uses `frameq://auth/callback` deep links. The browser receives a short-lived ticket, and the desktop client exchanges that ticket for an opaque session token.
- The user-facing entitlement is a monthly pass. Activation codes are the current administrator-issued way to open or extend that monthly pass, and they update the same `Entitlement` record used by the processing gate.
- WeChat purchase is paused because of WeChat approval requirements. Any WeChat payment route must remain disabled and hidden by default unless the product explicitly re-enables that channel.
- Each activation grants 20 insight-generation uses. The desktop worker checks out one use before generating insights, then calls the LLM supplier directly with the returned config.
- Admin Web access is limited to the configured administrator email and uses short-lived HttpOnly cookie sessions.
- The account service never receives video files, audio files, transcripts, generated insights, cookies, model caches, or local history contents. It may store and return the dedicated FrameQ client LLM key.
- The existing local worker pipeline remains the only place where video extraction, ASR, and InsightFlow execution happen.

## 模块关系

下面这张图描述一次任务在代码中的真实调用链：`app/src` 触发 Tauri command，Tauri 通过 IPC 调用 `worker/frameq_worker` 的 facade，facade 按阶段调度 `media` / `asr` / `insightflow` / 平台 fallback 模块，写入 app-local data 的 `outputs/`、`cache/`、`models/`。`server/` 不在主流程调用链上，仅在 `retry_insights` 二次确认时通过 server-managed LLM checkout env 注入 LLM 配置。节点旁的 `<br/>` 标注是该模块最先要打开的 2-3 个关键文件，方便顺着图找到入口。
